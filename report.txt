Frontend Development
--------

- I began by thoroughly reviewing the provided documentation to
understand the project's requirements.

- To ensure a smooth development process, I set up Docker and read
the Swagger documentation for a clearer grasp of the API's functionality.

- With a solid understanding of the project scope, I proceeded to create
the necessary HTML and JS files for implementation.

- Utilizing JSDoc comments helped me maintain code quality, ensure type
safety, and enhance the readability of my JS code. Additionally,
I enriched the project by incorporating extra styles and functionalities.


Observations
---------

- In the game.py file, I identified an issue within the _check_winning_conditions
method, notably when a win condition occurs on the last move. Specifically, the
condition `if self.board.count('-') == 0:` was positioned above WIN_CONDITIONS
checks. Although uncertain about these modifications without confirmation,
I fixed it.

- There are several options to serve index.html, however I added a line
of code at the beginning of server.py, enabling it to be served from the "/" path.


Suggestions
---------

- Implementing a confirmation dialog when starting a new game while a game is
already in progress.

- Allowing players to enter their names before starting the game.

- Keeping track of the number of wins for each player across multiple games.

- An undo button that allows players to take back their last move.

- Offering different difficulty levels for players to choose.

- Enhancing the UX with animations and sound effects.
